$lyrics = "江主席，你觉得董先生连任好不好啊？
好啊。
中央也支持他吗？
当然啊！
现在那么早你们就说支持董先生，会不会给人一种感觉，就是内定，钦点董先生？
没有任何意思。还是按照香港基本法，选举法，去产生......
刚才你问我，我可以回答你说“ 无可奉告”，你们也不高兴，那怎么办？
那董先生......
我的意思不是我钦点他当下任，你问我支持不支持，我是支持的，我就明确的告诉你。
你们啊，我感觉你们新闻界还要学习，你们非常熟悉西方的这一套媒体。
你们毕竟TOO YOUNG，你明白我的意思吗？
我告诉你们，我是身经百战了，见得多啊。
西方的哪一个国家我没有去过？
你们要知道美国的华莱士，比你们不知要高到哪里去了，哎，我也跟他谈笑风声。
媒体啊，还是要提高自己的知识水平，晓得不晓得啊？
唉，我也替你们着急啊，真的。
你们有一个好，全世界跑到什么地方，比其他的西方记者跑得还快，
但是问来问去的问题啊，都TOO SIMPLE，SOMETIMES NAIVE。
懂了没有？懂不懂得？
我很抱歉，我今天是作为一个长者跟你们讲，
我不是一个新闻工作者，但是我见得太多了，我有这个必要告诉你们一点人生的经验。
刚才我很想，我每次碰到你们......
中国有句话，叫“ 闷声大发财”。
我什么话也不说，这是最好的。
但是我想，我见到你们这样热情，一句话不说也不好。
所以刚才你一定要，在宣传上将来如果报道上有偏差，你们要负责，
我没有说要钦定，没有任何这个意思。
但是你们一定要问我，董先生你支持不支持。
我们不支持他，他现在当特首，我们怎么能不支持特首？
但是如果说连任呢？
连任要按照香港法律，对不对？
要......要要按照香港的......当然我们的决定权也是很重要的。
香港特别行政区属于中华人民共和国的中央政府！啊！
到那个时候我们会表态的。明白这意思吗？
你们呀，不要想喜欢弄大新闻，说现在已经钦定了，就把我批判一番，你们呐，NAIVE！
I AM ANGRY！你们这样是不行的！
这个engineering drawing（工程作图）呢，我们就有几年用鸭嘴的笔，旁边一个小盒子。
最痛苦的，就是鸭嘴笔把这个水弄到里面，描图的时候一下子就……然后就用刀片刮，这个就是描图最痛苦的，而且这个效率efficiency……
我的这个经历就是到了上海，到了89年的年初的时候，我在想我估计是快要离休了，我想我应该去当教授。
于是我就给朱物华校长、张钟俊这个...院长，给他们写了一个报告。
他们说欢迎你来，不过，这个Apply for Professor（申请当教授），你要去做一个报告。
我就做了一个能源与发展趋势的主要的节能措施，这个报告经过好几百个教授一致通过。
那么上海交大教授当了以后我就做第二个报告，就是微电子工业的发展。
这两个报告做了以后不久，过后，1989年的5月31号北京就把我调到北京去了。
现在这个报告做了快20年了，所以呢我就去年呢在我们交大的学报，我发表了两篇文章，就是呼应这个89年的报告的。
特别是昨天晚上，他又把我这个第二篇报告，还有我这十几年包括在电子工业部、上海市所做的有关于信息产业化的文章，总共我听他们讲是27篇……
我也没有什么别的东西送给你们，我们拿来以后我叫钱秘书啊，就把这两个学报，两个学报的英文本
因为他们这里洋文好的人多得很哪──英文本，还有前面出过两本书
再加上昨天晚上出的这本书，送给郭伟华同志，给你送过来，那么给你们作为一个纪念。
那么人呐就都不知道，自己就不可以预料。
一个人的命运啊，当然要靠自我奋斗，但是也要考虑到历史的行程。
我绝对不知道，我作为一个上海市委书记怎么把我选到北京去了，所以邓小平同志跟我讲话，说“中央都决定啦，你来当总书记”
我说另请高明吧。我实在我也不是谦虚，我一个上海市委书记怎么到北京来了呢？
但是呢，小平同志讲“大家已经研究决定了”
所以后来我就念了两首诗，叫“苟利国家生死以，岂因祸福避趋之”
那么所以我就到了北京。到了北京我干了这十几年也没有什么别的
如果说还有一点什么成绩，就是军队一律不得经商！这个对军队的命运有很大的关系。
因为我后来又干了一年零八个月，等于我在部队干了15年军委主席。
还有九八年的抗洪也是很大的。但这些都是次要的，我主要的我就是三件事情，很惭愧，就做了一点微小的工作，谢谢大家。
这是我用过的啊？老由啊，现在他们文印的图章里面绝对没有这枚图章，都不知道有这么一个东西……这就是说明二院的档案工作做得太好了！
你们给我搞的这本东西啊，Excited！
天堂的下面是你们的天堂。
为了使得我们今天晚上的这个环境更加的轻松一点，我回忆起我曾经在1945年、46年的大学年代，经常我们喜欢玩儿“Hawaii guitar”，经常弹奏的《Aloha 'Oe》这个歌曲。
在我祝酒之前，我去弹一曲《Aloha 'Oe》这个 Guitar，请州长夫人演唱！
Time flies very fast.
We met for the first time in 1986.
That’s right. When I was mayor of Shanghai.
Out of doors, near the Huangpu River.
And…I’m very happy to meet you again today.
I hope to convey through your program my best wishes to American people, and you.
That’s right. Of course, including everybody, because, I have many, many friends in America.
All friends!
Many statesmen in the world had moved up gradually, I was the mayor, and then the Party Secretary in Shanghai.
In fact, I did not think I would be transferred to the Central Committee here in Beijing.
But finally I was the man who selected.
Deng Xiaoping and other leaders of the old generation want me to become General Secretary of Communist Party.
I did not expect this.
However I’ve been in this position for 11 years, and I always held the conviction that I need to do my very best to serve my country and my motherland.
And may be it is because my hard work and my diligence that I still have the job.
But I think my answer is roughly the same length as your question.
If you give concise and brief questions, I’ll give you brief answers.
People use the same phrase to describe the character of Deng Xiaoping, I don’t think I should be put on the power of Deng.
But one thing of myself is that, fore sure is that I’m a decisive fighre.
In fact, “a needle wrapped in silk” is a very high compliment in Chinese, so I think I should be more modest.
On the whole, the relations between China and the United States are good.
However, I would like to use words people used to describe nature to describe the state of China-US relations.
Our relations have experienced wind, rain and sometimes cloud or even dark clouds or even dark clouds.
However sometimes it clears up.
We all sincerely hope to build a constructive partnership between China and the United States.
I don’t think “politician” is a very nice word.
“Stateman”?
I have a lot of friends in the United States, both Democrats and Republicans.
And every time I have meeting with them, we exchange views and great candor and great frankness.
So candidly speaking, maybe it is because of the strong economic power and leading edge in science and technology that the United States enjoys,
that more often than not it tends to overestimate itself and its position in the world.
Today I want to convey a friendly message to the American people.
But I do want to say there may be a certain touch of hegemonism in the leadership of the United States.
Well, as I said to you earlier, I hope that our talk today,
I would be able to convey a message of friendship and mutual understanding between the Chinese and the American people.
So if you permit, I would like to refrain from using too much tough words in our conversation.
I think that I’ve made myself very clear, when I said the United states enjoyed a developed economy, and also a leading edge in science and technology.
This has put you in a rather advantage position. And very often makes you feel more equal than the rest of the world.
Well, I’m not talking about the United States’ attitude towards China in particular.
China is a country with 5,000 years of history, and also more than 1,200,000,000 people.
We have accumulated a significant economic foundation over the past 20 years of the reform and opening-up.
So I’m afraid the United States simply cannot afford to look down on China.
In fact I was in middle school.
And later, when I was a teacher in the night school in Shanghai, I also selected Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address as a part of my course.
And you maybe want me to quote some lines from that speech.
“Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation,
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”
I’m particularly interested in the phrase, “all men are created equal“.
Because this has a great influence on some of students when I was young in the middle school.
And I think what Abraham Lincoln described in the article still remains the goal of American leaders today.
Especially the last paragraph: “The government of the people, by the people and of the people, never perish from the earth.”
That’s right.
I want to tell you that I also believe that I’m an elected leader, although we use different ways of election.
The only difference between China and the United States on this specific question is the different system of election we use in our two countries,
because China has its own historical tradition, its own level of education and economic development and social development and so on.
So I think each country should have its own individual system of election.
Why is there necessary to have opposition parties? It shows you don’t understand Chinese history.
America thinks the whole world should adopt American values and American political system, I don’t think that is wise.
You mean I’m dictatorship?
Of course. This is a big mistake.
Of course. It shows you do not know China that well.
Would you please tell me what means dictatorship?
You mean in China, there’s not.
I think for every individual country or any individual party, they always have their own publications to promote their own ideology.
As I explain to you, the Chinese system is multi-party system led by the Communist Party.
And we do have the freedom of the press.
We have over 2,000 TV stations in the country. We have more than 2,000 local newspapers and more than 8,000 magazines.
We publish more than 100,000 new books each year.
Even Mao tsetung advocated the policy of allowing “one hundred different flowers to bloom,
and one hundred different sores of schools of thought” contend in the field of art literature.
But the direction was right, even today, we still pursue the same direction.
You were right in saying that I did make a visit in people’s daily back 4 years ago,
but I’m afraid I never put things that way.
So there may be a certain distortion about what I really said.
What I want to explain to you is that we are such a big country with the population of over 1,200,000,000,
that direction on media tries to lead our country toward is important.
You cannot possibly try to use the American values to make judgements about China,
because you are highly developed in you economy, and your level of education.
You cannot possibly try to make China to same as the United States.
I think for both Chinese media and the foreign media, one thing is very important.
They should never distort the fact, though they are free to their on opinion.
This is very important for the Chinese media, particularly the People’s Daily,
because it is the major newspaper for the Chinese people. If there’s a mistake in the newspaper,
people will believe what they read. The situation is different from yours,
you can report ant any story anyway you want. Even if you make mistakes in your newspaper,
it won’t make serious consequences. For example, I’m here right now, talking to you,
in Beidaihe. I’ve read some foreign papers that say I’m in Dalian right now.
If there reports were ture, how could I possibly be sitting here talking to you?
And I will tell you another thing. A few month ago, I read a piece of news from the Internet saying,
that was Jiang Zemin was visiting the army in Xiamen, there was a very serious explosion,
and Jiang Zemin was severely hurt in hospital rest, However, at that time, I was in Beijing.
Your press and our press both made mistakes, but the influence is greater.
Let me say about the Chinese population. Everyday 52.000 babies are born in our country.
This will add up to 20,000,000 a year.
And this significant growth of our population has been seen under very strict family planning policy.
So I often ask myself, how to ensure a happy life in constantly improve living standards for the 1,200,000,000 Chinese people.
This is indeed, a very tough job.
Let me be very frank with you, before coming to Beijing, I was the No.1 in Shanghai, the Party Secretary.
I had no intention of leading the whole country here, and I hope that more capable candidate will take the job.
But Deng Xiaoping and other leaders from the old generation believe I was the appropriate candidate.
So I was selected to be the General Secretary of the Communist Party.
Now I can only “devote myself to do anything I can to serve the country and my people until the last minute of my life”.
Military committee.
You were right. I’ve never served in the army in the military because I am an intellectual.
That’s ture. I haven’t said that though.
I have served as chairman of the central military commission for 11 years.
I think I have the confidence of the army.
As chairman, I don’t personally need to fire a gun or fly a airplane.
My responsibility is to make strategic decisions.
Oh, this is my decision.
I think the army is allowed to do business and that would erode our army.
Because history has told us that any army that is allowed to engage in business eventually becomes corrupted and that would destroy the marrow and the flighting will of the army.
I think corruption is a historical phenomenon, in that it happened in different countries in the ancient times,
and it still happens in different countries today.
We have been fighting resolutely against corruption.
There’ve been very serious corruption cases in our country.
I hate corruption very much, but I don’t think the problem can be solved overnight.
And in order to gradually eradicate the problem, we need to depend on our legal system,
on our media, and also on improved education. You were right that during the disturbance of 89,
some students were chanting slogans against corruption, so the specific point,
the Party shares the same position with the students.
But the fact is that there’re some people with ulterior motives who are trying to use the enthusiasm of the students to overthrow the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and overthrow the socialist government,
this will never be allowed.
So we have to take resolute measures.
And had we not done so, we would not have the national stability we have today,
a stability that benefits China and the rest of the world.
In Shanghai, that’s right.
I first joined the student movement against the Japanese military in China.
And after World War II, we were against the Nationalist regime.
Because back then, there was no freedom and democracy in the country.
But ever sincr the People’s Republic of China was founded,
we’ve always been working to further promote the democracy in our country.
Even in the 1989 disturbance as I told you before,
we could understand the passions of students who are calling for greater democracy and freedom.
And we in fact, have always been working constantly up to today to improve our system of democracy.
And the crux of the matter was that we could not possibly allow those people with ulterior motives to use student movement to overthrow the government.
Well, about the internet, I think we discuss this issue before when we were talking about freedom of the press.
We hope that we could learn a lot of useful things and useful information from the Internet,
however, sometimes there’s also unhealthy stuff especially pornography on the Internet, which does great harm to our youngsters.
As for example you’ve given, such as BBC and the others,
they might be banned because of some of their political news reports.
We need to be selective. We hope to restrict as much as possible information not conducive to China’s development.
Li Hongzhi.
You met him?
At first I would like to ask you that you also trust Falun Gong?
I’ll tell you. Li Hongzhi claims to be the reincarnation of the chief Buddha,
and also a reincarnated Jesus Christ.
Do you believe that? He said that doomsday was about to come and he also said the earth was going to explode.
He also claims that I and Mr. Li Peng former Premier, used to call him on the telephone,
asking him to delay the date of the explosion of the earth maybe of several decades.
But we’ve never talked to him. Well, I make all his claims he wants to achieve nothing but people’s trust,
people’s belief in him. He wants to create the impression that he knows the Chinese leaders very well.
In fect, what he says are misleading words. In fact, as a result of his preaching,
many families were broken and many lives were lost. So after careful deliberations we drew the conclusion that Falun Gong is a cult.
One Thing we have to make clear.
Just mow, you mixed up two things: Christianity and Falun Gong.
Under China’s constitution that Chinese people have the freedom of religious belief,
including the freedom to believe in Christianity. But Falun Gong is a cult.
It is totally different from Christianity. When I was a college student, I sometimes attended Christmas Eve Party.
No. But like anyone else, Christians should not break Chinese laws.
I know, famous scientist.
Chinese? Overseas Chinese.
Overseas Chinese.
I can tell you frankly, China was not in any way involved in Wen Ho Lee’s case. We only know about Wen Ho Lee is a renowned scientist.
If he not? This is just natural for him to come and visit us and to talk with the Chinese scientists.
Just as normal as some Chinese scientists to also travel abroad.
Well, I’m by no means trying to defend Wen Ho Lee, he can defend himself.
However, allow me quote a Chinese proverb which says that “if you are out to condemn someone,
you can always trump up a charge”. We don’t know what political motives are behind it. I’ll tell you an example.
The very famous scientist, Einstein. He invented the theory of Relativity.
That’s right. In 1905 and 1916. In 20 century, if no quantum theory, no relative theory, it will be no atomic bomb.
But Einstein, I’m convinced that, Einstein, he didn’t like to use his theory to make the bomb, you know.
So I don’t think it’s appropriate for people to think that exchanges among scientists should have a problem unless some people were trying to achieve some political purpose.
Up to today, the Chinese still see Wen Ho Lee as a very well-renowned scientist.
That’s all.
Of course.
This is not difficult to me. This is your feeling.
Maybe under the lights.
But what do you think?
You say Wen Ho Lee’s a spy, Chinese spy, or not?
That’s right. You are to consider carefully.
You have the information may be much more than I.
I’m only from the newspaper.
But I think…
But I think first time I…
No. first time I discover you face the difficult to answer this question.
I think I’ve already said everything I want to say about the Wen Ho Lee Case.
I hope the United States will not have any racial discrimination in handling such cases,
in that instead it will follow the principal that all men are created equal, as advocated by Abraham Lincoln.
I don’t side with any individual political party in the United States because I have many friends in both parties.
Anyway, I’m a member of Communist Party of China.
It is a tradition to move our office here every summer.
But in fact, we are not having a vacation here because we conduct our normal business as we do in Beijing, except here we may go for a swim.
My doctor often suggests that I should siwm, I swam this morning for 21st time this summer.
That may be a coincidence that we all swam. But it is true that swimming makes you feel relaxed and refreshed.
You may be right about the timing, it was maybe 4 years ago, in fact, this question is a frequently discussed topic for us.
China is a nation with a long history, and we have already attached great importance to spiritual civilization and moral integrity.
And the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as advocated by Deng Xiaoping,
does allow certain people in some areas to become rich first, but the ultimate objective is to achieve common prosperity.
“To get rich is glorious” is not capitalism. Socialism is to make their country strong and prosperous.
In February, I visited the part of the Guangdong Province,
where I said to the people there that you are richer than some other parts of China,
and you need to think about the source of your wealth that you should build up your prosperity and not to just sit back and enjoy what you have achieved.
I think the last thing world leaders want to see is the scenario while you have material wealth on one hand, but moral decline on the other.
I’m afraid I can’t give you a clearer answer about this decadence than you can, because I have not lived In the United States.
For example, Las Vegas, I’ve never been there, but I’ve seen it on movie pictures.
I and the American leaders including former president Bush and Carter,
and the current president Clinton are worried about the influence of decadence on the morals of young people.
We don’t have any objections to western films.
In fact, I’m also a viewer of the western movies.
When I was a college student, I loved A Song to Remember, Waterloo Bridge, Bathing Beauty, and How Green Was My Valley.
I’ve seen many American and European films.
Well, about decadence. Our two countries may be different in terms of historical tradition, way of life and religious belief etc.
So maybe there are things that you aren’t regarded as decadent in the United States, that are regarded as decadent in China.
That’s why we have to be very selective. For instance, Titanic was a big hit in China, and I watched the film.
I also saw Gladiator and Forrest Gump.
For example, the movie called gladiator describes a part of history in the Rome Empire, there may be a slight deviation from the historical truth.
But it is something we fully understand. It is an artistic creation.
As I said to you earlier, I have a lot of good friends within the leadership of the two parties, and many members of two parties.
Are you just joking? We have never done such thing.
I have read the campaign platforms of both parties and I believe whoever becomes president
too will try to improve the friendly relations between China and the United States for this is in the strategic interest of the whole world.
Someone asked me not to pay attention to unfriendly remarks candidates might make about China during the campaign because once elected,
they will be friendly. I only hope that’s true.
You’ll know that.
Traveling?
Let me be frank with you, I think China and the United States differ greatly in terms of value.
You Americans always use your own value and logic in making judgements about the specific situations or say political situation of other countries.
Your American values emphasize deal making, but what we value most is a good collective where people support and assist each other.
You also have mutual support in your country, but our perception of the word “deal” is different from your word in the west.
The purpose and principal of the Communist Party are to serve the People, in this process, we win the trust and confidence of our people.
Since the founding of the People’s Republic, we have travelled through twists and turns in our decades of developing the nation.
The policy of reforming and opening-up, initiated by Deng Xiaoping, was a great success. So now, we are building a China, socialism with Chinese characteristics.
But people in the west always hope that Chinese can become a capitalistic country.
But with only one system around. Would the world be a very dull place?
I still believe the world should be a diverse and colorful one.
We want to learn from the western world everything advanced and progressive, including science and technology, and its experience in managing economy.
Of course, this must be combined with specific conditions here.
And it’s exactly because we have followed these principles that we have scored great achievement in the past few decades.
I think it’s just normal for China to gradually strengthen our capability for national defense.
We are opposed to national missile defense and theater missile defense plan. We are ambiguous about this.
Because that would create an atmosphere where people cannot possibly engage in the effort to achieve the common task of peace and development.
Our national security interest must not be impaired in any way. Your missile defense may naturally be perceived by people as a kind of threat.
It is a threat against us. For instance, we are worried about the possibility of Taiwan being incorporated into a US-Japan missile defend system.
Most importantly, the leaders of both countries should scale a great height and adopt a long term perspective.
We need to stand high and look far.
And in fact, when I was having my very first meeting with President Clinton in 1993, I quote a Chinese line, “to have a grand sight, you must scale a great height.”
And when vice president Gore travelled to China, I also quoted some lines from the Song Dynasty.
It goes, “I do not fear the floating clouds might block my view, because I am standing on the highest peak.”
The United States is a much younger country compared with China, so may be you have fewer historical burdens.
And your people demonstrate an innovate inspiration spirit.
No, but I… Very frank speaking, I don’t agree with your point, I’m a dictator.
I think your way of describing what things are like in China is absurd as what Arabian nights may sound like.
The reality in China is that we have leadership by the Communist Party.
According to law, the Party only makes recommendations.
Everything needs to be approved by the National People’s Congress.
Of course.
All the ministers, their nomination are approved by the National People’s Congress, and also the leadership of the State Council.
So the State Council looks after the day-to-day business of the country.
The supreme power of the Communist Party lies with the National People’s Congress.
And the National Congress chooses the Central Committee, and the Central Committee has a Politburo.
The Politburo has a Standing Committee of which I am a member.
So every week the Standing Committee members have a meeting.
And the meeting is held in an open, democratic atmosphere, when one member of the Standing Committee has objection, I’ll not make a decision.
Don’t need translation. I know what you said, ha ha.
I’m very willing to answer these questions because Barbara Walters of BBC had asked me the same question about 10 years ago and gave me a photo.
And I said this young man was not arrested and did not get hurt because the tank stopped in front of him and refused to crash him. And Barbara also gave me the name of who she believed was the young man,
although I may have forgotten the specific name.
but I ask people who are working with the public security agencies to use all of their networks to check out where was that young man,
And after a month-long investigation, I can say for sure that this young man has not been arrested.
In fact, I’ve never met this young man, although we try to search out where was that, but we do know that he was never arrested.
I do not know where he lives now in China.
But looking at the picture, I know he definitely has his own ideas, but whether his idea was a correct one, that’s entirely a different question.
I cannot tell for sure who and what influences him.
Well, I know what you are driving at, but what I want to emphasize is that we fully respect people’s rights to freely express their wishes and desires.
But I do not favor any flagrant opposition for the government measures during an extortionary situation.
The tank stopped, and did not run over the young man. Even under extortionary circumstances, our troops remain very rational and reasonable.
In 1943, I was still in Nanjing, attending university.
The Japanese occupied many parts of China, including Nanjing.
The Japanese wanted the Chinese to get addicted to opium, so we launched an entire opium movement and smashed many opium houses.
When we confronted the Japanese military who are pointing their bayonets and guns at us, we sang a protest song Arise My Fellow Classmates and Defend the Motherland.
♪ Arise! My fellow classmates! It’s time to shoulder your responsibility to defend our motherland!
Take a sound of people’s bemoan! Have a view of this invaded country! ♪
We selected over the people a sample to ask their opinion, and we try to know what they are thinking.
And also, we also make the conclusion based on scientific methods.
Well, I also have some personal contacts and keep in personal touch with people.
Well, let me put it the other way around. The United States has state-of-the-art technology,
so all the explanations that they have given us for what they call a mistaken bombing are absolutely unconvincing.
This for me is also a question. Also a question.
Because you have such state-of-the-art technology, and sophistic military command system with advanced radio communication device,
and also the identification marks for the Chinese embassy in Belgrade were too clear for people to miss.
So why did this happen? It’s still a question. But we still adopted an attitude of looking forward to improving Chinese-US relation in the new century.
After the incident took place, President Clinton call me on the telephone several times explaining his apology to me.
And I said to him that after the bombing in Belgrade of the Chinese embassy, the 1,200,000,000 Chinese people, they all stood up in an angry raw against the incident.
And I said to the president, to your president, though we have a very large population,
we still highly cherish each and every Chinese life, which we believe, is all too, too precious.
We lost 3 lives in that bombing. And I said to him, it’s not easy to guide the feelings of 1,200,000,000 angry people towards sensibility in good reason.
And since you represent Americans, just as I represent Chinese, it would be impossible for us to reach total agreement on this issue.
That’s right. My term for the president will end in 2003, and for General Secretary in 2002.
Oh, you ask very sharp tough questions.
Well, I’m afraid I can’t give you a definite answer today at this moment, because what will happen will be decided through our democratic system.
It all depends on what entire Chinese people and what entire membership of the COC will say.
Anyway, we have to make sure that the stability is maintained in such a big country with 1,200,000,000 population.
I’m convinced that this interview will be further promoting the friendship and mutual understanding between our two peoples. That is all.
That’s right. I’m convinced that. I trust it.
I want to promote mutual understanding between our two peoples.";

								<h3>你好，蛤蛤</h3>
								<p>这不是一个普通的插件，它象征着一代人的膜蛤精神，以及大家对长者的热情，它会在前台或者后台每个页面显示一句来自长者的经典语录，不但能够让访客变得Excited，还能让你的博客变得更快。</p>
								<p>真正的粉丝，即使是一个简单的 WordPress 插件，也会感到自己的时间过得很快。+<span id="times">1s</span></p>
								<p>如果您钦定了 WP SuperCache，可能会导致前台的语录被缓存，很江硬，不会随机显示，建议关闭首页的缓存功能。</p>
